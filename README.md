# All-in-one-page


This repository contains the files of my very first JavaScript project! This project is supposed to be an all-in-one pager, a page that you would keep open on one of your screen and where you can find all the basic information and tools you normally use when you are using your PC.

This page regroups information suchs as the date and time, live cryptocurrency rates, live weather forecast, shortcuts to all my social media profiles and other websites I use frequently (StackOverflow, Google, GitHub, etc) as well as a calculator, a music player, a converter and a to-do list.
