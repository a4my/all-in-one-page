# All-in-one-page üí•


This repository contains the files of my very first JavaScript project! This project is supposed to be an all-in-one pager, a page that you would keep open on one of your screen and where you can access in one click the basic information and tools you normally use when you are using your PC.

This page regroups information suchs as the date and time, live cryptocurrency rates, live weather forecast, shortcuts to all my social media profiles and other websites I use frequently (StackOverflow, Google, GitHub, etc) as well as a calculator, a music player, a converter and a to-do list.

## What I used üî®
My goal with this project was to build my own project from scratch to practice HTML, CSS, SASS, using APIs and JavaScript. 

## Extra learning ‚úî
I also wanted to use neumorphism design and to implement a dark mode feature.

## Responsiveness ‚ùï
Since this project is supposed to be a full page that you would normally keep open on the side, I did not make this project responsive on smartphone screens.
